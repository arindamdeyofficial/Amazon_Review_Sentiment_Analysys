Right now I am not clear regarding what are the best products to invest in if I consider myself as a small investor (willing to invest up to 5 lakh Rupees) and so it is quite obvious I consider myself as a risk-averse investor.\n",

    "## Sentiment analysis can be classified into three types.\n",
    "### Predictive sentiment analysis\n",
    "This type of sentiment analysis aims to predict how people will feel at a future date about a particular topic or product. For example, if we want to know how people will feel about a new phone in six months time, then we can use predictive sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of sentiment analysis is not used for decision making, but rather for understanding behaviors in the future. One of the most common applications for predictive sentiment analysis is to predict a product’s financial performance. By using predictive sentiment analysis, product developers can measure the general public's interest in the product and make decisions accordingly (e.g., they can decide on the promotion strategy for the product).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnostic sentiment analysis\n",
    "This type of sentiment analysis aims to understand how people are feeling about an object/topic right now by analyzing historical data on that object/topic. For example, when looking at how people felt about a particular brand over time, diagnostic sentiment analysis would help to determine whether there was an increase or decrease in positive feelings towards the brand over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of sentiment analysis is used to investigate problems and identify trends in data that affect decision making. While predictive sentiment analysis predicts how people will feel in the future, diagnostic sentiment analysis investigates problems and identifies trends in data that affect decision making. A popular example of this application is detecting harmful content online (e.g., detecting fake news).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment classification\n",
    "This type of sentiment analysis classifies texts with sentiments that are ambiguous or unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment classification can be useful when trying to find out if a particular piece of text is positive or negative based on its content (e.g., whether a review accurately reflects its star-rating).\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP techniques used in sentiment analysis\n",
    "There are several techniques used for sentiment analysis. Let’s explore a few major options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag-of-words Bag-of-words sentiment analysis uses the frequency of positive and negative words in an article to determine its overall sentiment. It is an unstructured approach, meaning it does not rely on understanding the meaning of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has been criticized for being simplistic and not able to accurately identify sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. This approach calculates the degree to which a word is present in an article, relative to how common it is in all articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF sentiment analysis measures the importance of words in driving sentiment in an article and ignores words that are common in all documents. TF-IDF has been criticized for being computationally intensive and unable to accurately measure sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word embeddings Word embeddings is a vector representation of natural language data using real values between -1 and +1. This approach calculates the degree to which words are present in an article, relative to how common they are in all articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec Word2Vec is an artificial neural network model, which maps words from text documents into vectors that are used as inputs for machine learning algorithms like regression or classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to mapping words into vectors, Word2Vec also predicts their probability distribution, making it possible to detect words with similar distributions but different spellings."

    "## Functions for Preprocessing\n",
    "Expanding Contractions Contractions are shortened version of words or syllables. They exist in either written or spoken forms. Shortened versions of existing words are created by removing specific letters and sounds. In case of English contractions, they are often created by removing one of the vowels from the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "By nature, contractions do pose a problem for NLP and text analytics because, to start with, we have a special apostrophe character in the word. Ideally, we can have a proper mapping for contractions and their corresponding expansions and then use it to expand all the contractions in our text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Special Characters One important task in text normalization involves removing unnecessary and special characters. These may be special symbols or even punctuation that occurs in sentences. This step is often performed before or after tokenization. The main reason for doing so is because often punctuation or special characters do not have much significance when we analyze the text and utilize it for extracting features or information based on NLP and ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenizing Text Tokenization can be defined as the process of breaking down or splitting textual data into smaller meaningful components called tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence tokenization is the process of splitting a text corpus into sentences that act as the first level of tokens which the corpus is comprised of. This is also known as sentence segmentation , because we try to segment the text into meaningful sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word tokenization is the process of splitting or segmenting sentences into their constituent words. A sentence is a collection of words, and with tokenization we essentially split a sentence into a list of words that can be used to reconstruct the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Stopwords Stopwords are words that have little or no significance. They are usually removed from text during processing so as to retain words having maximum significance and context. Stopwords are usually words that end up occurring the most if you aggregated any corpus of text based on singular tokens and checked their frequencies. Words like a, the , me , and so on are stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correcting Words One of the main challenges faced in text normalization is the presence of incorrect words in the text. The definition of incorrect here covers words that have spelling mistakes as well as words with several letters repeated that do not contribute much to its overall significance.\n",
